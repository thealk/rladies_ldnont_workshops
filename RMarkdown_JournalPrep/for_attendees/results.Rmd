```{r setup_results, include=FALSE}
# Important: If this is a child doc, you can't have duplicate chunk names
#    e.g., setup exists in the parent .Rmd, so I've changed this chunk name to setup_results
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r source, include=FALSE}
source("helper.R")
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Don't forget the plot we made! We can further customize it here
```{r}
calsugs_plot+
     theme_bw()+
     xlab("Sugars (g)")
```

We can also just redo the plot
```{r fatPlot, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = starbucks, aes(x = total_fat, y = Calories, color=kind)) + 
     geom_point()+
     geom_smooth(method="lm")+
     facet_wrap(~size)+
     theme_bw()
```


Here are some tables too
```{r eval=FALSE}
kable((summary(cal_mod)$coefficients), digits=3)
```

Other stuff
- How do we change the row names?
- if p < 0.001, can we write it out that way?


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

Figure \@ref(fig:figlabel) is shown here. 

```{r figlabel, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A nice figure caption", fig.height=12, fig.width=10}
plot(pressure)
```
