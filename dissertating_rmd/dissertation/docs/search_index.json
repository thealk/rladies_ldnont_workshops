Specifically, it will walk you through one method of organziing, writing, and rendering a dissertation with these tools, using an adapted version of the Western University thesis templates. This tutorial was written by me, Thea Knowles. At the time of writing, I am currently in the throes of dissertating. This means that there are likely several details I haven’t quite hammered out yet, or techniques I’ve missed. In the last year and a half, I’ve been collecting other people’s tutorials and resources on using RMarkdown + for the purposes of using it to write a dissertation. The final product is my interpretation of these resources, adapted to my needs, and presented here as a “What-I’ve-learned-so-far”-style tutorial. 1.1 Prerequisites In order to use this tutorial, you need the following: R RStudio Recent versions of RStudio also include Pandoc, which is required to compile documents Latex for Mac or Windows (if you want to compile to PDF). Alternatively, install TinyTex, the Latex distribution created and recommended by Yihui Xie, creator of RMarkdown and bookdown1. R packages: if(!require(devtools)) install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;, repos = &quot;http://cran.rstudio.com&quot;) install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot;) install.packages(&quot;knitr&quot;) TinyTex is probably the best way to go because Yihui always anticipates the problems we will run into, but I personally have not used it.↩ "]
