# Introduction
Here is an introduction. 
This paper explores the relationship between height and weight of Starwars characters.

When Starwars was released as a book [@lucas1977], the films were already in production.
Here are some more citations from our bibliography [@brodeur2016; @means1985]. 
@bundy1984 demonstrated the use of an inline citation here.


# Methods {#methods}
Here is the methods section. Refer to this section in the manuscript.Rmd file to see how we:

1. Input a table that does not use R code
2. Insert a figure that does not use R code
3. Insert an equation
4. Insert a footnote

## Insert Markdown tables
The following table similarly demonstrates absolutely nothing useful except how to generate a simple table in RMarkdown.

Here are some ways of inserting Markdown tables:

1. By hand using standard Markdown syntax
2. Using a [Tables Generator website](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)
3. Using the [`remedy` RStudio addin](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/remedy)

## Insert a figure

## Insert equations
Here is a nifty equation that shows absolutely nothing except how to include an equation: 

<!-- COMMENTS! -->
<!-- The text enclosed in dollar signs $ $ will be treated as LaTex math (an equation), and will be formatted especially for this -->

George Lucas' income = $\frac{N\ times\ people\ have said\ May\ the\ Force\ Be\ With\ You}{Carrie\ Fisher}* \$ 1\ bazillion$. 

## Insert footnotes.
Because we specified footnotes in the markdown extensions in our YAML[^1], we can now include them in the text.

[^1]: This is the footnote.

# Results

This is where the results will go in a moment. For now, notice the chunk is commented out.

I have written the results section separately to keep things nice and tidy, and this is where I will call it as "child" input. 
It is important that R chunks (identifiable as sandwiched between three back ticks \`\`\`) in the child file don't have the same names as chunks in the main file.

<!-- ```{r child = 'results.Rmd'} -->

<!-- ``` -->

# Discussion
Discuss.
