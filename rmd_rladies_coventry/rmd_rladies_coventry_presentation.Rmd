# Essential parts of any R Markdown document

## Essential parts of any R Markdown document

<img src="../img/rmarkdown_parts.png" width="800/"/>

## YAML

[YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) (rhymes with camel): The header that tells R Markdown how to generate your document. Indentation and spacing are very important.

-   Permits the following to happen when you knit:

    -   .Rmd -\> knitr -\> .md -\> Pandoc -\> output
    -   Output can be .docx, .html, .pdf, and many others

-   YAML: "YAML Ain't Markup Language"

## YAML

**Basic:**

```{r eval = FALSE}
title: "Untitled"
author: "Thea Knowles"
date: '2018-02-18'
output: word_document
```

## YAML

**More options...**

```{r eval = FALSE}
title: "Changes in voice acoustics along a speech rate continuum
        in Parkinson's disease"
author: "Thea Knowles, Scott G. Adams, Mandar Jog"
date: Last updated `r Sys.Date()`
output:
  bookdown::word_document2:
    reference_docx: "../rmd_templates/custom_reference.docx"
  redoc::redoc:
    highlight_outputs: FALSE
    margins: 1
    line_numbers: FALSE
bibliography: references.bib
csl: "csl_files/apa7.csl"
```

## YAML

::: {.columns-2}
**Even more options...**

-   templates for Word, PDF, etc.
-   bibliography file
-   **csl** (references style guide)
-   **css** (supreme customization!)
-   journal articles, slides, websites

**Different options for:**

-   [HTML output](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/html_document_format.html)
-   [Word output](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/word_document_format.html)
-   [PDF output](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/pdf_document_format.html)

*Note: We will just learn about HTML output today*

## Essential parts of any R Markdown document

<img src="../img/rmarkdown_parts.png" width="800/"/>

## Code chunks

-   [*Chunks*](http://yihui.name/knitr/options/) are sections that will include R code. By setting defaults at the beginning of your document, you can specify what you want most of your chunks to do.

-   In each chunk, you can specify options in the form `tag=value` in the chunk header.

    -   For example, in the following, the tag `include` is set to `FALSE`, indicating that we don't want the contents of this chunk included in the output

## Code chunks
- Let's say we want to include a code chunk that assigns x the value of 10.
- Here are some ways we can do that.

## Code chunks

**First, insert a new R chunk by**

- Typing `Alt + Cmd/Ctrl + i` OR
- Clicking `Code >> Insert Chunk` from the R Studio menu

## Code chunks
### Bare R code chunk (no labels or options)

````markdown
`r ''````{r}
x <- 10
```
`````

## Code chunks
### Give it a **label** ("my-chunk")

````markdown
`r ''````{r my-chunk}
x <- 10
```
````
    
*`r emo::ji("warning")` Chunk labels CANNOT contain spaces, underscores, or special characters, but CAN contain hyphens.*

## Code chunks
### Tell RMarkdown what to do with it (Set **chunk options**)

````markdown
`r ''````{r my-chunk, echo = FALSE}
x <- 10
```
````

In this example, we set the `echo` option:

- `echo = TRUE`: show the code in the rendered Rmd document
- `echo = FALSE`: don't show the code in the output, but DO run it in the background

## Code chunks: More options

## Code chunks: More options

> `r emo::ji("right_arrow")`[RStudio lesson](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-3.html)

> `r emo::ji("right_arrow")`[Knitr book chapter](https://yihui.org/knitr/options/)

## Code chunks: Special setup code chunk

Let's say you want to set default behavior for all of your code chunks. You can do this using the `knitr` package in a special chunk at the beginning of your document. 

When you create a new Rmarkdown document from the default template, this is included for you:

````markdown
`r ''````{r setup, include=FALSE}
    knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
````

## Code chunks: Special setup code chunk

````markdown
`r ''````{r setup, include=FALSE}
    knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
`r ''````
````

This chunk provides the following information for "knitting" the document:

-   **setup**: the name of the chunk You shouldn't have two chunks with the same name, unless they are unnamed (in which case they just get numbered automatically during the knit process)
-   **include = false**: the chunk will not be included in the output after knitting.
-   **knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)**: set `echo = TRUE` for all chunks (you can still set `echo = FALSE` in individual chunks later if you want)

# R Markdown | Text in Markdown syntax

## Markdown {.unnumbered}

**Markdown**: set of conventions for editing plain text.

Write as you normally would in a text editor or word processor, but you signal text formatting with certain characters (next slide).

Markdown (which is distinguished from *markUP* language) is designed to be

-   [**easy to read**]{style="color:red"}</span>
-   [**easy to write**]{style="color:red"}
-   [**easy to learn** ]{style="color:red"}

## Markdown syntax

<img src="../img/markdown_syntax_rstudio.png" width="800/"/>


## Markdown syntax

Tables written like this:

    First Header  | Second Header
    ------------- | -------------
    Content Cell  | Content Cell
    Content Cell  | Content Cell

-   See [Tables Generator website](http://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)

-   *See `remedy` and `beautifyR` R packages/RStudio addins for dealing with markdown tables*

-   Data frames can be turned into tables without manual modification

    -   *See `kable` and `flextable` R packages*

## Inline R code
You can refer to variables stored in R in your code using the syntax:
  `` `r
      [r code here!]` ``
      
### Example:
Earlier in your code you have assigned `x <- 5` in an R chunk

```{r}
x <- 5
```

Typing 

<span style="color:red">
<center>
The value of x is
      `` `r
      x` `` 

</span>
</center>

<span style="color:grey">
will print
</span>


<span style="color:red">
<center>
The value of x is `r x`
</center>
</span>




## `r emo::ji("memo")` <span style="color:red"> Exercise 3 </span> | Customize
In the Rmarkdown document you created from the default template...

<font size = 4>

1. Delete everything after Line 12 (after the setup code chunk)
2. Add a new header
3. Add some plain text
4. Add some **bold** text
5. Add a code chunk that includes `x <- 5` and `x`
6. Include a line that says:


      The value of x is
      `` `r
      x` `` 


7. Compile! ("Knit"): Cmd/Ctrl + K or with Knit button.

</font>


# Part 2 | Scaling up to real-world use

## My habits
- do my data cleaning/exploration in a separate .R script ("helper.R")
- *source* my `helper.R` file in my RMarkdown document and use code chunks to polish figures/tables
- include in-line R code that refers back to R objects made in helper.R



## `r emo::ji("memo")` <span style="color:red"> Exercise 4 </span> | Create `helper.R`

First: make sure `simulated_vot_data.csv` is in your project folder (same level as the .RProject). Then:

1. Create a new .R script 
2. Add the following code
3. Save it as `helper.R` in your project folder (same level as your .RProject for now)

```{r eval = FALSE, include=FALSE}
vot <- read.csv("simulated_vot_data.csv")
vot_m <- mean(vot$VOT)
```

Try to run the code in the R console.

`r emo::ji("bug")` We can pause to diagnose any errors people run into!

## `r emo::ji("memo")` <span style="color:red"> Exercise 5 </span> | Source & use the code in `helper.R` in your RMarkdown document

Open your .Rmd file and insert a new code chunk below the setup chunk


````markdown
`r ''````{r source-helper}
    source("helper.R")
    
    min(vot$VOT)
    max(vot$VOT)
`r ''````
````

Knit the .Rmd document. What do you see?

`r emo::ji("bug")` We can pause to diagnose any errors people run into!


## `r emo::ji("memo")` <span style="color:red"> Exercise 6 </span> | Add in-line R code

Below your R chunk, add the following lines:


The mean VOT is
`` `r
vot_m` ``.

The mean VOT is
`` `r
min(vot$VOT)` `` 
and the max VOT is
`` `r
max(vot$VOT)` ``.


## `r emo::ji("memo")` <span style="color:red"> Exercise 7 </span> | Add a plot

Add another code chunk:

````markdown
`r ''````{r vot-distribution}
    hist(vot$VOT)
`r ''````
````

## Exponentially useful
The ability to refer to your code in your document becomes EXTREMELY helpful once you start creating multiple figures, reporting summary variables and tables of statistics

## Build your skills gradually
Build your skill set to tailor to your goals: Some guiding suggestions based on my own experience

  - Start with using R Markdown to tell the story of your data to you, to your supervisor (summary reports)
  - If dissertating - start early! Use RMarkdown as a way to keep track of your data. Compile frequently and read up on project management
  - Write an article in RMarkdown & learn how to use templates, reference management integration, and .RData files
  - Present your data using RMarkdown
    - This presentation uses the `ioslides_presentation` output, but [`xaringan`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/xaringan.html) is an extremely powerful & popular tool for RMarkdown presentations
    
## R Studio Visual R Markdown `r emo::ji("fire")`
- RStudio v1.4 released a mode to edit markdown more easily - the result is a word processor-style experience
- I still recommend getting the basics down first, but this is an exciting development
